Ballgame Scheme
===
A simplefied, clean, refreshing and new Scheme, with *first-class* macros
---
Ballgame Scheme aims to be mostly compatable with R6RS Scheme, while radically simplifying and improving many things that are seen as downsides, compared to most languages. Our goals are:

* Simpler, more usable, and more powerful macros
* First-class macros, becouse we can!
